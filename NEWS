  2016-05-03
  1. Added automatic test cases.
  2. Removed an incorrect warning message when the number of clusters is equal
     to the number of unique elements in the input vector.
  3. Changed from 1-based to 0-based C implementation.
  4. Optimized the code by reducing overhead. See 22% reduction in runtime to

  3. When lower bound of the number of clusters is greater than the unique
     number of elements in the input vector, both the min and max numbers of
     clusters are set to the number of unique number of input values.
  4. When the upper bound of the number of clusters is greater than the unique
     number of elements in the input vector, the max number of clusters is set
     to the number of unique elements in the input vector.
